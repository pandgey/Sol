# The algorithm

A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** algorithm that uses a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to process data and provide context-aware responses based on user queries.  

This project is still **a work in progress**, but contributions are more than welcome — feel free to dive in, experiment, and improve it! :>

## To-Do List

- Write full documentation (WIP)  
- Fine-tune the algorithm for performance and accuracy  
- Create a user interface for easier interaction
