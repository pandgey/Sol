Every computer, phone, or server that connects to the internet gets one, so data knows where to go and where it came from! 💻🌐 There are two main types: **IPv4**, which looks like `192.168.1.1`, and **IPv6**, which is longer—like `2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2`. They’re used by routers and servers to deliver information correctly—kind of like how mail needs the right address to reach your house!"
